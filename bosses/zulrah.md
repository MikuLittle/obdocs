This page is intended to briefly explain the useful things you can do with Zulrah uniques.

For information regarding boosts and requirements of Zulrah, please visit the [relevant page](https://wiki.oldschool.gg/bosses/boosts-and-requirements#other-bosses).

### Unique Items

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Tanzanite fang.png>) **Tanzanite fang**

The Blowpipe can be created from the fang (requires 53 fletching) and is an integral item for ToB and Inferno.

* **To create the blowpipe:**
  * `/fletch`` `**`name:`**` ``Toxic blowpipe (empty)`
* **To add darts and scales**
  * `/minion blowpipe`` `**`add:`**` ``Dragon dart`` `**`quantity:`**` ``1000`
  * `/minion blowpipe`` `**`add:`**` ``Zulrah's scales`` `**`quantity:`**` ``1000`
* **To remove darts and scales**
  * `/minion blowpipe`` `**`uncharge:`**` ``true`
  * `/minion blowpipe`` `**`remove_darts:`**` ``true`

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Magic fang.png>) **Magic fang**

The Magic fang can be used to create 2 different staves (requires 59 crafting) and both provide boosts to Kraken and Thermy bosses. Once created, these 2 items _cannot_ be reverted to their base form. You can [charge](../miscellaneous/charging-items.md) only the toxic trident, which gives some benefits in PvM.

* `/create`` `**`item:`**`Toxic staff (uncharged)`
* `/create`` `**`item:`**`Uncharged toxic trident`

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Serpentine visage.png>) **Serpentine visage**

The Serpentine helm can be crafted from the visage (requires 52 crafting). It is currently only used at ToA for replacing the need for Sanfews while charged and equipped.

The helm can be created with the following command:

* **To create the helm:**
  * `/craft`` `**`name:`**` ``Serpentine helm (uncharged)`
* **To charge the helm**
  * `/minion charge`` `**`item:`**`Serpentine helm`` `**`amount:`**`X`

Currently have no use. They _cannot_ be added to the serpentine helm.
